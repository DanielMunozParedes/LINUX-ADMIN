# **Sentinel - Automated Linux Server Security & Monitoring**  

> *Project #1 of my Linux Administration & Security portfolio.*  
> *This is part of my hands-on journey in cybersecurity and server hardening. Built from scratch, it demonstrates real-world security skills while remaining open to improvements and feedback.*  

**Sentinel** is a **lightweight, automated security system** designed to **harden Linux servers, monitor logs, and send real-time alerts** when threats are detected. It integrates **fail2ban, UFW, and custom scripts** for active protection against attacks.  

---

**Features**  

**Automated Security Hardening** â€“ Configures **SSH, firewall (UFW), and fail2ban** automatically.  

**Intrusion Detection & Log Monitoring** â€“ Real-time monitoring of logs for brute force attempts and unusual activity. 

**Telegram Alerts** â€“ Sends instant security notifications to your phone when suspicious activity is detected.  

**Custom Firewall Rules** â€“ Dynamically adjusts firewall settings based on detected threats.  

**Attack Simulation Scripts** â€“ Test your security setup by simulating real-world cyber attacks.

**How It Works**  

ðŸ”¹ **Log Analysis** â€“ Monitors `/var/log/auth.log` and `/var/log/syslog` for suspicious activity.  
ðŸ”¹ **Automated Actions** â€“ If an attack is detected, Sentinel can:  
   - Block the attackerâ€™s IP with **UFW**.  
   - Add the attacker to **Fail2Banâ€™s blocklist**.  
   - Send a **Telegram alert** with details.  
ðŸ”¹ **Attack Simulations** â€“ Test security by running a simulated attack (`simulate_attack.sh`).

**A Self-Taught Journey in Cybersecurity**  

This project is part of my **self-taught** learning path in **Linux security and automation**. Iâ€™ve built Sentinel to **apply real-world cybersecurity concepts**â€”but also as a way to **push myself, learn from the community, and continuously improve**.  

**To recruiters and hiring managers:** Iâ€™m not just learningâ€”Iâ€™m actively building, breaking, and securing systems. **Sentinel is proof of my hands-on expertise.**  

**To the community:** I welcome feedback, suggestions, and improvements! If you see ways to make Sentinel better, Iâ€™d love to collaborate.
